# JS Drumkit

This is the first 'thing' I made following the [30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com). This course is duly, highly recommended! The promise of the course is to build 30 different tiny projects, with the following characteristics:
- No Frameworks
- No Compilers
- No Libraries
- No Boilerplate

# How to use
Caution: This demo makes fairly loud sounds. If you are in an office environment, consider using headphones or wait till you go home.

Visit the [demo site](https://capex.github.io/js-drumkit) and use your keyboard to play different tones.
