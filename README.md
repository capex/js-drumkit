# js-drumkit

This is the first 'thing' I made following the [30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge](https://javascript30.com). Duly, highly recommended! The promise of the course is to build 30 different tiny projects, with the following characteristics:
- No Frameworks
- No Compilers
- No Libraries
- No Boilerplate
